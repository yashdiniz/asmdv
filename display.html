# Welcome to Another Simple MarkDown Viewer
This is a very simple MarkDown viewer intended to be used for displaying MarkDown documents at presentations. Originally, it was created for the sole purpose of displaying my college assignments(whose essay I had written in MarkDown even though the professor wanted it in either a Word Document or HTML format) and was created in around 10 minutes(so kindly report any bugs that I can fix) before assignment presentation. _Fortunately, everything worked out well._

Writing MarkDown documents is so simple you can learn the basics in less than an hour from [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). After that, all you need is a text editor that allows you to save text files, and you are good to go!
