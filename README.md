# Another Simple MarkDown Viewer

This is a very simple MarkDown viewer intended to be used for displaying MarkDown documents at presentations. Originally, it was created for the sole purpose of displaying my college assignments(whose essay I had accidentally written in MarkDown even though the professor wanted it in either a Word Document or HTML format) and was created in around 10 minutes before assignment presentation. Fortunately, _everything worked out well_.

Writing MarkDown documents is so simple you can learn the basics in less than an hour from [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). After that, all you need is a text editor that allows you to save files with the extension `.md`, and you are good to go!

> **P.S.**: Owing to the fact that I had initially written this program in 10 minutes, I would expect many bugs and errors to have crept in.
> I welcome any form of feedback, and pull requests as well! Thank you!
